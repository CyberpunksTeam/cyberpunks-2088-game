### CyberPunk NFTs and Ability Cards
- CyberPunk NFTs: These are unique, non-fungible tokens representing individual cyberpunks within the game. Each cyberpunk has its own set of stats, abilities, and traits, making them valuable assets in battles. Players can acquire these NFTs through various means, such as purchasing them from the in-game marketplace or earning them as rewards.
- Ability Cards: Ability Cards grant cyberpunks additional powers and advantages in battles. These cards can be used strategically to deal damage, heal allies, or apply status effects to opponents. Players must carefully choose which Ability Cards to include in their deck and when to use them during battles to maximize their effectiveness.

### Progression Systems
- Leveling Up. As players engage in battles and earn victories, their cyberpunks gain experience points (XP) and level up. Leveling up increases their base stats and unlocks new abilities, enhancing their combat capabilities.
- Enhancement. Players can enhance their cyberpunks by upgrading their NFT cards using $CBPZ tokens earned in battles. Enhancements may include boosting stats, unlocking additional ability slots, or improving existing abilities. This allows players to tailor their cyberpunks to suit their preferred playstyle and strategy.

## Marketplace and Trading
In CyberPunks2088 Game, players have access to a dynamic and player-driven marketplace where they can buy, sell, and trade in-game items, including CyberPunk NFTs and Ability Cards. This marketplace serves as the central hub for transactions, fostering a vibrant economy within the game and allowing players to customize and enhance their gameplay experience.

### Buying algorythm
- NFT Integration. The marketplace seamlessly integrates with external platforms like [TensorTrade](https://www.tensor.trade), where players can purchase CyberPunk NFTs directly from other players or from the developers. These NFTs represent unique cyberpunks with their own distinct traits and abilities, and players can browse through a diverse selection of cyberpunks available for sale.
- In-Game Upgrades. Once players acquire CyberPunk NFTs, they have the option to enhance and upgrade them within the game using $CBPZ tokens earned through battles. This includes improving their stats, unlocking new abilities, or customizing their appearance. The marketplace provides a platform for players to trade upgraded cyberpunks, allowing them to showcase their investments and strategic choices.
- Ability Cards Trading. In addition to cyberpunks, players can also buy, sell, and trade Ability Cards in the marketplace. These cards grant unique powers and advantages in battles, and players can customize their decks by acquiring new cards or exchanging duplicates with other players. The marketplace facilitates the exchange of Ability Cards, enabling players to fine-tune their strategies and adapt to different opponents.
- Player-Driven Economy. The marketplace operates on a player-driven economy, where supply and demand dictate prices for in-game items. Players have the freedom to set their own prices when listing items for sale, creating opportunities for trading and speculation. This encourages active participation and engagement within the community as players seek to acquire rare and valuable assets.
